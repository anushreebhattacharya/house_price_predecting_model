# House Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This project is a machine learning model to **predict house prices** based on features such as total rooms, population, and more. It uses Python with libraries like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `numpy`. This model can help real estate analysts and buyers estimate house prices from input data.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Log transformation for skewed numerical features
- Train-test split for model evaluation
- Model training and prediction
